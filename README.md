# better-jsonapi
A better Python SDK for the Bukkit plugin JSONAPI

# Features
* Leverages the power of JSONAPI for making API requests to a Bukkit server with the ease of Python
* Now supports sending multiple commands as opposed to the native SDK which only allows one at a time
* Advanced support for API responses

# Documentation
Read the Python docstrings for more information on each method

# Usage
* Add JSONAPI-supported commands to the stack by using add(command_name, arguments...)
* Push all commands in the stack to the server via an API request with send_all()

# Source
The JSONAPI for version 1.15.2 is found at: https://github.com/alecgorge/jsonapi to be used in conjunction with this SDK
